1. Create Address Book Database (UC1) :

CREATE DATABASE AddressBookDB;
USE AddressBookDB;

---

2. Create Address Book Table (UC2) :

CREATE TABLE AddressBook (
    ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    LastName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    Address VARCHAR(255),
    City VARCHAR(50),
    State VARCHAR(50),
    ZipCode VARCHAR(10),
    PhoneNumber VARCHAR(15),
    Email VARCHAR(100),
    BookName VARCHAR(50), -- New field for Address Book Name
    BookType ENUM('Family', 'Friends', 'Profession') -- New field for Address Book Type
);

---

3. Insert New Contacts (UC3) :

INSERT INTO AddressBook (FirstName, LastName, Address, City, State, ZipCode, PhoneNumber, Email, BookName, BookType)
VALUES
('John', 'Doe', '123 Main St', 'New York', 'NY', '10001', '1234567890', 'john.doe@example.com', 'Personal', 'Family'),
('Jane', 'Smith', '456 Elm St', 'Los Angeles', 'CA', '90001', '9876543210', 'jane.smith@example.com', 'Work', 'Profession');

---

4. Edit Existing Contact by Name (UC4) :

UPDATE AddressBook
SET PhoneNumber = '1112223333', Email = 'new.email@example.com'
WHERE FirstName = 'John' AND LastName = 'Doe';

---

5. Delete a Contact by Name (UC5) :

DELETE FROM AddressBook
WHERE FirstName = 'Jane' AND LastName = 'Smith';

---

6. Retrieve Contacts by City or State (UC6) :

-- Retrieve all contacts from a specific city :
SELECT * FROM AddressBook WHERE City = 'New York';

-- Retrieve all contacts from a specific state :
SELECT * FROM AddressBook WHERE State = 'NY';

---

7. Get the Count of Contacts by City and State (UC7) :

SELECT City, State, COUNT(*) AS ContactCount
FROM AddressBook
GROUP BY City, State;


---

8. Retrieve Entries Sorted Alphabetically by Name for a City (UC8) :

SELECT * FROM AddressBook
WHERE City = 'New York'
ORDER BY FirstName, LastName;

---

9. Add Address Book Name and Type (UC9) :

ALTER TABLE AddressBook
MODIFY COLUMN BookName VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
MODIFY COLUMN BookType ENUM('Family', 'Friends', 'Profession') NOT NULL;

---

10. Get Count of Contacts by Type (UC10) :

SELECT BookType, COUNT(*) AS ContactCount
FROM AddressBook
GROUP BY BookType;

---

11. Add Person to Multiple Types (UC11) :

Since MySQL does not support direct multi-value attributes, create a junction table :

CREATE TABLE AddressBookTypes (
    ContactID INT,
    Type ENUM('Family', 'Friends', 'Profession'),
    FOREIGN KEY (ContactID) REFERENCES AddressBook(ID)
);

-- Add John Doe to both Family and Friends
INSERT INTO AddressBookTypes (ContactID, Type) VALUES (1, 'Family'), (1, 'Friends');

---

12. ER Diagram Notes (UC12) :
You can draw the ER Diagram with the following entities:
- AddressBook : Represents contact details.
- AddressBookTypes : Represents the many-to-many relationship between contacts and types.

Key relationships:
- `AddressBook(ID)` â†’ `AddressBookTypes(ContactID)`

---

13. Validate Queries (UC13) :

- UC6 (Retrieve Contacts by City/State):
  SELECT * FROM AddressBook WHERE State = 'CA';

- UC7 (Sorted Entries by City):
  SELECT * FROM AddressBook WHERE City = 'Los Angeles' ORDER BY FirstName;

- UC10 (Count by Type):
  SELECT BookType, COUNT(*) AS CountByType FROM AddressBook GROUP BY BookType;

- UC11 (Multiple Types):
  SELECT AB.FirstName, AB.LastName, ABT.Type
  FROM AddressBook AB
  JOIN AddressBookTypes ABT ON AB.ID = ABT.ContactID;
